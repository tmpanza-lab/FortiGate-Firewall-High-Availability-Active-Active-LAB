# FortiGate Firewall â€“ High Availability (Active-Active) LAB

## Objective

This lab provides practical experience for network administrators and engineers in deploying and managing high-availability networks using FortiGate firewalls simulating, configuring, and testing an environment where multiple FortiGate firewalls are set up in an Active-Active HA mode. The goal is to understand how the FortiGate devices work together to enhance network reliability, performance, and redundancy.

### Skills Learned

- FortiGate Firewall Administration
- High Availability (HA) Configuration
- Load Balancing and Traffic Optimization
- Network Redundancy and Reliability

### Tools Used

- FortiGate VM: A virtual appliance used in virtualized environments, such as VMware or Hyper-V
- FortiOS Web Interface (GUI)
- FortiOS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- FortiView Dashboard: Built-in monitoring tool for real-time traffic and event analysis.
- Backup and Restore Tools
- FTP/HTTP/HTTPS Servers: For uploading firmware or serving configurations during the lab.
- Traffic Generation Tools
- GNS3 for simulated network devices (e.g., routers, PCs, or switches) to test

Before Enabling HA we should review Those Recommendations:

- we need to have the same FortiOS version (Firmware) in the units.

- we need to have the same hardware Model. 

- the interfaces should not be on DHCP.

 
* On FortiGate we have two modes of HA 

Active-Active (a-a): in a-a mode the traffic start load balancing between the cluster members when we have a policy with a security profile enabled or when our unite reach the maximum sessions supported.

Active-Passive (a-p): in a-p mode the traffic get handled by one member of the cluster while the other member stay on standby waiting for the active unite to fall.

## STEPS


# Changing the cluster member role
in order to make a member role as primary you need to:

1)	Use this following command from CLI:

2)	2) Disconnect and Reconnect cable from the interface which is being monitored on the primary.

We will see that our FortiGate cluster members are synchronized now that mean that the

configuration of our FortiGate 1 which is the primary replicated to our FortiGate 2.

## Access from Primary unit to the secondary ##

# Set MGMT IP To HA Clusters

* We have the same IP of our primary FortiGate, so we can only now see our primary.

 


# Please Note That in a-a mode the replication of the configuration is from the two members (Primary to Secondary and Secondary to Primary)
